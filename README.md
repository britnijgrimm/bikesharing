# Bike Sharing

## Overview
We were *so* impressed with our bike sharing experience in New York City, we want to bring the same joy to tourists and the citizens of our hometown, beautiful Des Moines, Iowa!

We have developed a [Tableau Story](https://public.tableau.com/profile/britni.grimm3857#!/vizhome/CitiBikeNYC_16125620906210/NYCCitiBike?publish=yes) based on New York City data from August of 2019 to present our research and findings to our investors and stakeholders. Below we will outline some of our findings and some questions that still remain unanswered for us.

## Results

### Top Start and End Locations
You will notice two maps on this page of our narrative. Our left-hand map depicts the most-visited starting locations in NYC and the right-hand map depicts the most-visited ending locations in NYC. Both maps look quite similar! We can see that many of the top starting locations coincide with the top ending locations, meaning similar numbers of bikes are picked up and returned to the same locations.

What we cannot immediately deduce is the final destination of our rider. Was this simply the closest drop off? Do our riders have locations they prefer to pick up or drop off? Will they go out of their way for those stations? Did they catch the subway to finish off their commute? What makes these popular locations popular? Answering some of these questions will help us develop a strategy for our program in Des Moines.

### Trip Duration for Users
This visualization displays the length of time that bikes in New York City were checked out. We can see that nearly 150,000 bikes had been checked out for a duration of about five to six minutes during August of 2019. Fewer and fewer bikes were checked out for longer periods of time. In fact, there were no trips recorded in August that lasted an hour or longer.

We were not expecting to see such short ride durations amongst these riders. Considering how congested NYC can get, we expected to see longer ride times. Perhaps the mobility of riding a bike in the city is what makes this model attractive!

### Trips by Weekday per Hour
This heatmap clearly demonstrates that the population of NYC is utilizing these Citi Bike bikes to supplement or shorten their commute. Weekday afternoons between 5:00 and 7:00 PM saw the highest use. Followed closely by weekday mornings between 7:00 and 9:00 AM. Thursdays saw a marginally higher demand than other days of the week. As for weekends, Saturday saw a slight increase around Noon, although both Saturday and Sunday were busy throughout the day.
We would certainly expect weekends and commuting times to see an increase in activity, but what does this tell us about the city and its riders? What is the distribution of leisure riders to commuters?

### Trips and Trip Duration by Gender
Something we found quite interesting during our research was the distribution of Citi Bike’s customer base. Only about a quarter of bike sharing patrons are female. Barring around 225,000 customers that did not report their gender, the remaining customers are men and according to the data for 2019, most of them were subscribers.

Is this distribution of male to female riders proportionate to the distribution in New York City? I would venture to say no, the men in NYC do not so severely outnumber the women. How can we attract more female riders and even more female subscribers? What piece of the puzzle is missing in New York that we could provide here in Des Moines? 

## Summary
The largest takeaway from this analysis of Citi Bike dataset is that commuters are utilizing bike sharing services during rush-hour windows and on weekends. We also know men largely make up Citi Bike’s customer base and they are riding short distances or for short periods of time.

### Recommendations
If we want to gain a better understanding of the long-term viability of deploying a bike sharing program in our community, I would like to conduct similar analyses on a wider dataset. August is a desirable time of year to visit New York City. How does the possibility of tourism or nicer weather impact our analysis?

Similarly, to understand the nature of our riders’ commutes, mapping out their routes or visualizing the distance between start and end stations might provide us with some information of the efficiency of bike sharing as a viable mode of transportation in this city.

To understand the impact maintenance has on the overall business model, I would like to see data on individual bikes including number of tips, hours logged per trip, and the cost and frequency of maintenance on each machine. 

Finally, I would like to see more in-depth user data. We have their gender and date of birth, which can provide us with some clues about our customer. Understanding their occupation, household size and income might give us a wider view of our rider or potential new customers.
